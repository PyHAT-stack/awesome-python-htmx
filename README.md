# PyHAT: Awesome Python htmx [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Are you interested in the intersection of Python and [Hypermedia-Driven Applications](https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-driven-applications/)? Head on over to the [discussions tab](https://github.com/PyHAT-stack/awesome-python-htmx/discussions), [introduce yourself](https://github.com/PyHAT-stack/awesome-python-htmx/discussions/2), and let's [get to work](https://github.com/PyHAT-stack/awesome-python-htmx/discussions/1)!


## What is PyHAT? üßê <a name = "about"></a>

PyHAT is more than just a snake with a hat üêçü§†. It stands for Python htmx ASGI Tailwind&mdash;a web stack that allows you to build powerful web applications using nothing more than... drumroll... Python, htmx, and Tailwind.

Quick, <a name="tools">take me to the tools already</a>!

### Our Goal

We want to promote hypermedia driven applications. That's it. That's the goal.

Okay, well, more specifically, we want to promote htmx within the Python ecosystem.

### Why Should I Care?

Does any of this sound like you:
- I want to stick with just Python and HTML/CSS, [but not sacrifice front-end functionality](https://htmx.org/essays/when-to-use-hypermedia/).
- I don't want to have to use a [complicated front end framework](https://htmx.org/essays/a-response-to-rich-harris/).
- I don't enjoy [agonizing over CSS class names](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first#:~:text=You%20aren%E2%80%99t%20wasting%20energy%20inventing%20class%20names.).
- I want to maintain a consistent design without any bikeshedding.

If the above sounds like you then you are in the right place!

### Maybe This Isn't For Me

One of the links above goes to [When Should You Use Hypermedia](https://htmx.org/essays/when-to-use-hypermedia/) over at htmx.org, and is a pretty great read if you want to asses if this is for you. It also expounds on the following points:

Hypermedia might not be a good fit:
- ‚Ä¶If your UI has many, dynamic interdependencies
  - i.e., Google Maps, Google Sheets
- ...If you require offline functionality
- ‚Ä¶If your UI state is updated extremely frequently
  - i.e., Online game
- ‚Ä¶If your team is not on board

### But Will it Work in Production?

Yes! [Here is a very good example](https://htmx.org/essays/a-real-world-react-to-htmx-port/) of a project a company underwent using HTMX with Django in production. You can also watch the original video from DjangoCon EU 2022, titled [From React to htmx on a real-world SaaS product: we did it, and it's awesome!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GObi93tjZI)
<details>
<summary>Some highlights from the article.</summary>

> - The effort took about 2 months (with a 21K LOC code base, mostly JavaScript)
> - No reduction in the application‚Äôs user experience (UX)
> - They reduced the code base size by 67% (21,500 LOC to 7200 LOC)
> - They increased python code by 140% (500 LOC to 1200 LOC), a good thing if you prefer python to JS
> - They reduced their total JS dependencies by 96% (255 to 9)
> - They reduced their web build time by 88% (40 seconds to 5)
> - First load time-to-interactive was reduced by 50-60% (from 2 to 6 seconds to 1 to 2 seconds)
> - Much larger data sets were possible when using htmx, because react simply couldn‚Äôt handle the data
> - Web application memory usage was reduced by 46% (75MB to 45MB)

## Glossary :scroll:

- **Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI)** - A standard that allows an application to talk to a server, allowing for multiple, asynchronous events per application. <br>
- **component** - A reusable custom element. Within JavaScript, it is a self-contained element with its own properties/methods that are reusable. In this context, the term is more broadly applied to any reusable elements (which may include hypermedia or other design elements). <br>
- **dependency** - Any application (librariy or package) that are required to run your application. <br>
- **fragments** - Refers to partial content of a an HTML template. See also: _template fragments_ </br>
- **hypermedia** - Medium of information including graphics, audio, video, text, and hyperlinks, typically represented on the web as HTML <br>
- **Hypermedia Driven Application (HDA)** - Uses declarative, HTML embedded syntax to achieve front-end interactivity, while interacting with the server in terms of hypermedia (HTML) instead of a non-hypermedia format (JSON). <br>
- **partials** - A loose term, sometimes referring to "partial" content that can be displayed in a template, or _partial_ content to be generated from within a template block.<br>
- **Server Side Rendering (SSR)** - Generating static HTML markup on the server before it is rendered in the browser on the front-end. <br>
- **Single Page Application (SPA)** - A web app implementation that loads a single web document, and subsequently updates content through JavaScript APIs.<br>
- **template fragments** - a relatively rare SSR template library feature that allow you to render a _fragment_ or partial bit of the content within a template, rather than the entire template.


## Usage ‚úèÔ∏è <a name = "usage"></a>

Htmx can be used with any backend framework. Currently, there is a lot of experimentation in the Python space, which is exciting! But that also means that there are a lot of disparate approaches.

The best advice here is to get familiar with some of the core packages (htmx, tailwind). Then feel free to check out any of the packages below.


## Official Resources üìö

-   [htmx](https://htmx.org/) - htmx gives you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML, using attributes, so you can build modern user interfaces with the simplicity and power of hypertext. Htmx has no outside dependencies outside of a vanilla JavaScript file referenced in your HTML `<head>` section.
-   [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML. Tailwind provides a standalone CLI tool that _does not_ require npm or any other JavaScript dependencies. (You can install it through `pip` using the [pytailwindcss](https://pypi.org/project/pytailwindcss/) library)

A django app that combines and helps leverage the full-stack django framework, the frontend htmx framework, the django-htmx library, and the jinja template engine. It provides extended django Views with htmx build-in functionality, CRUD Views for django models, extra Mixins to use with your Views to make life easier, a ready-to-use jinja environment, Middlewares for automations, and extra utils and decorators for common use cases.

### Components

- **[Django Dashboards](https://github.com/wildfish/django-dashboards)** <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Django-a9bbcc?style=flat&logo=django&logoColor=black" alt="Django"></a> <br/>
Tools to help you build data dashboards in Django.
- **[django-htmx-autocomplete](https://github.com/PHACDataHub/django-htmx-autocomplete)** <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Django-a9bbcc?style=flat&logo=django&logoColor=black" alt="Django"></a> <br/>
A client-side autocomplete component powered by htmx featuring multiselect, search and is completely extensible.

### Tools

- **[django-tailwind-cli](https://oliverandrich.github.io/django-tailwind-cli/)** <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Django-a9bbcc?style=flat&logo=django&logoColor=black" alt="Django"></a> <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Tailwind_CSS-a9bbcc?style=flat&logo=tailwindcss&logoColor=black" alt="Tailwind CSS"></a><br/>
An integration of Tailwind CSS for Django that is based on the precompiled versions of the Tailwind CSS CLI (No JS required!)
- **[pytailwindcss](https://github.com/timonweb/pytailwindcss)** <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Tailwind_CSS-a9bbcc?style=flat&logo=tailwindcss&logoColor=black" alt="Tailwind CSS"></a><br/>
Tailwind CSS is notoriously dependent on _Node.js_. If you're a Python developer, this dependency may not be welcome in your team, your Docker container, or your inner circle. Giving up _Node.js_ means you won't be able to install plugins or additional dependencies for your Tailwind CSS setup. At the same time, that might not be a dealbreaker. You can still customize Tailwind CSS via the tailwind.config.js file.
- **[HTML Form to Dict](https://github.com/guettli/html_form_to_dict)**<br/>
Do simple end-to-end testing of form handling without a real browser (like selenium/puppeteer/playwright). Supports the "action" and "method" attributes of forms and additionaly the htmx attributes hx-get, hx-post.
